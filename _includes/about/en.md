Hi, I'm Kaylee, based in Edinburgh, Scotland󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿.  I am currently working on [blog](https://kaylee4m.github.io/), [Weibo](weibo.com/1660052222), [GitHub](https://github.com/kaylee4m), etc.

I studied Computing and IT from [University of St Andrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews) by 2019, and I am doing High Percormance Computing with Data Science at [University of Edinburgh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh) from 2019.
